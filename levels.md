Once an institution passes basic certification, it can get additional points to get higher levels.

Since not all challenges are applicable to all institutions, institutions are graded by the percentage of applicable challenges completed.

A draft of the levels and reasoning for version 0.1.0 can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJ0Q2rawdOzzph1_lJd_QpoG72fSNWGrikiQ7szc7Go/edit#"> here </a>. Everybody who cares is invited to submit suggestions.
