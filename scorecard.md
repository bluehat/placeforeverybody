Each institution is rated as pass/fail on a number of basic criteria, and then has the capacity to earn points on top of that.

If you pass all of the mandatory criteria you are "certified."

Points push an institution towards a higher rating.

Scorecard version 0.1.0 is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TX8jRTnjVh4OkY9dp4dT__Ku14zkFaKx0vreR1Hpf9w/edit#gid=0"> here</a>. We invite everybody who cares to submit suggestions.
